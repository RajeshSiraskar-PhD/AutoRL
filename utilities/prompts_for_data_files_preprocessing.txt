Tool_makers_report
------------------------

Create a python code for extracting information from individual report files into a single consolidated csv file

Instructions:
Folder and files:
- Two main folders: (1) 'Tool_makers_report' and (2) 'DAQ'
- Each of these have subfolders with names of the form '1. Sxxx | 2. Sxxx | 6. Sxxx' etc.
- Within each sub-folder, there are report files in either Word (docx extension) or Excel format (xlsx extension)
- File names are in format 'a1 | a2 | a3' etc.
You are to extract information from each of these report files a1, a2 and extract info into a single output .csv file
Output format desired: | Folder name | File name | Tool-wear micrometer |
Process files in folders within the main 'Tool_makers_report' folder:
- Take the first folder - name is of form '1. Sxxx' the 'xxx' part changes
- Copy this folder name into the 'Folder name' column of ouput
- Within each folder, there are report files in either Word (docx extension) or Excel format (xlsx extension)
- File names are in format 'a1 | a2 | a3' etc.
- Copy the report file being processed in 'File name' column of ouput
- Read each file and locate a table
- Locate a column called 'Length'
- This may contain a single or 2-3 rows.
- Take the maximum value of Length and copy into 'Tool-wear micrometer' column of output
